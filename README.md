# Facial Image Colorization and Editing with GAN Inversion
## Abstract:
Facial image colorization has numerous applications, such as the restoration of old photographs. In this project, we extend the task of colorization by incorporating image manipulation, allowing users to edit the reconstructed image and apply colorization based on the color histogram of another image. Our approach utilizes a StyleGAN-based method for both image colorization and editing.
