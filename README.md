# Facial Image Colorization and Editing with GAN Inversion
Facial image colorization has a number of useful
 applications, including the reconstruction of old images. By
 extending this problem, we also explored the manipulation of the
 reconstructed image and added the ability to colorize an image
 based on a color histogram of another image. Our methodology
 employs a StyleGAN-based approach for editing and colorizing
 images.
